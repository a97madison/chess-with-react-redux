== Developer Setup and generate folder `src-gen`

Developer setup and the generation of the `src-gen` folder (using the command line):

Open the project folder in a shell and execute the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
npm install      # download node_modules
npm run build    # generate js files in folder src-gen
----

== Create the application


The `package.json` defines a script `webpack` to create the application `chess-app.js`.
Run it with:

[source,bash]
----
npm run webpack
----

== Start local web server

The `package.json` defines a script `start` for starting the Webpack Dev Server serving the application to a browser on `http://localhost:8080`.
To start the web server, run:

[source,bash]
----
npm start
----
// end::CreateApp[]
